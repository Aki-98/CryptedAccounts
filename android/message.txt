Hello
Maikaru-Sensei,

I hope this email finds you well.

I recently started planning an Android application inspired by Microsoft's Authenticator, and I came across your project CryptedAccounts. I must say, your work is impressive and aligns well with my vision. I am writing to seek your permission to fork your project for further development.

Here are the key goals I aim to achieve:

- BringUp the project to Android S.
- Analyze potential attack scenarios and enhance security measures.
- Implement functionality similar to Authenticator, such as automatic key generation and a user-friendly feature to autofill keys into corresponding applications.
- Ensure the key generation process is transparent, with users having the option to input keywords to determine the encryption algorithm.
- Add functionality for transferring the password database to a new device via Bluetooth.
- Optionally, include fingerprint authentication to reveal sensitive information.

This new development will cater to users with higher confidentiality requirements, serving as a reliable password management terminal. 
It will not be used for commercial purposes but will be made available to those in need.

Could you kindly let me know which Open Source Software License governs your project? 
Would you be open to me forking your project to proceed with this development?

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Aki
